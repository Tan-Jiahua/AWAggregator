Description: This package implements an attribute-weighted aggregation 
    algorithm which leverages peptide-spectrum match (PSM) attributes to 
    provide a more accurate estimate of protein abundance compared to 
    conventional aggregation methods. This algorithm employs pre-trained random 
    forest models to predict the quantitative inaccuracy of PSMs based on their 
    attributes. PSMs are then aggregated to the protein level using a weighted 
    average, taking the predicted inaccuracy into account. Additionally, the 
    package allows users to construct their own training sets that are more 
    relevant to their specific experimental conditions if desired.
