# Introduction

The `AWAggregator` package implements an attribute-weighted aggregation algorithm which leverages peptide-spectrum match (PSM) attributes to provide a more accurate estimate of protein abundance compared to conventional aggregation methods. This algorithm employs pre-trained random forest models to predict the quantitative inaccuracy of PSMs based on their attributes. PSMs are then aggregated to the protein level using a weighted average, taking the predicted inaccuracy into account. Additionally, the package allows users to construct their own training sets that are more relevant to their specific experimental conditions if desired.

Since `ExperimentHub` can only retrieve data from the `AWAggregatorData` package with Bioconductor version 3.21 or later, please use the compatible version of the `AWAggregator` package if you are using an earlier Bioconductor version: https://github.com/Tan-Jiahua/AWAggregator-compat

```

## Ex.1: Aggregate PSMs Derived from FragPipe Using the Pre-Trained Model.

In this example, we aggregate the reporter ion intensities of PSMs to the protein level. We use the sample dataset `sample.PSM.FP`, included in the `AWAggregator` package and derived from the `psm.tsv` output file generated by FragPipe. This dataset includes reporter ion intensities from nine samples, labeled from `Sample 1` to `Sample 9`, without replicates. The PSMs are mapped to the following proteins: A0AV96, A0AVF1, A0AVT1, A0FGR8, and A0M8Q6, with unnecessary columns removed for clarity.

This example demonstrates the basic functionality of the `AWAggregator` package using the default pre-trained model.

```r
# Load the pre-trained random forest model that does not include the average CV as a feature, which indicates the average CV in percentage for processed PSM reporter ion intensities across different replicate groups. It is recommended to load the pre-trained model with average CV when replicates are available; otherwise, use the model without the average CV
data(sample.PSM.FP)
regr <- loadPretrainedModel(useAvgCV=FALSE)
samples <- c('Sample 1', 'Sample 2', 'Sample 3', 'Sample 4', 'Sample 5', 'Sample 6', 'Sample 7', 'Sample 8', 'Sample 9')
groups <- samples
df <- getAttributes(
    PSM=sample.PSM.FP,
    # TMT tag (229.1629) and carbamidomethylation (57.0214) are applied as fixed post-translational modifications (PTMs)
    fixedPTMs=c('229.1629', '57.0214'),
    colOfReporterIonInt=samples,
    groups=groups,
    setProgressBar=TRUE
)
aggregated_results <- aggregateByAttributes(
    PSM=df,
    colOfReporterIonInt=samples,
    ranger=regr,
    ratioCalc=FALSE
)
```

The output dataframe will provide estimates of protein abundance.

## Ex.2: Aggregate PSMs Derived from Proteome Discoverer Using the Pre-Trained Model.

In this example, we convert the search result from Proteome Discoverer to the format required by `AWAggregator` and aggregate the reporter ion intensities of PSMs to the protein level. We use the sample dataset `sample.PSM.PD`, alongside its corresponding protein table `sample.prot.PD`, both included in the `AWAggregator` package. These files are derived from the TXT exports of the proteins and PSMs pages in the search results from Proteome Discoverer. This dataset includes reporter ion intensities from nine samples, labeled from `Sample 1` to `Sample 9`, without replicates. The PSM and protein tables contains following proteins: A0AV96, A0AVF1, A0AVT1, A0FGR8, and A0M8Q6, with unnecessary columns removed for clarity.

```r
# Load the pre-trained random forest model that does not include the average CV as a feature, which indicates the average CV in percentage for processed PSM reporter ion intensities across different replicate groups. It is recommended to load the pre-trained model with average CV when replicates are available; otherwise, use the model without the average CV
data(sample.PSM.PD)
data(sample.prot.PD)
regr <- loadPretrainedModel(useAvgCV=FALSE)
samples <- c('Sample 1', 'Sample 2', 'Sample 3', 'Sample 4', 'Sample 5', 'Sample 6', 'Sample 7', 'Sample 8', 'Sample 9')
groups <- samples
df <- convertPDFormat(
    PSM=sample.PSM.PD,
    protein=sample.prot.PD,
    colOfReporterIonInt=samples
)
df <- getAttributes(
    PSM=df,
    # TMT tag and carbamidomethylation are applied as static PTMs
    fixedPTMs=c('TMT6plex', 'Carbamidomethyl'),
    colOfReporterIonInt=samples,
    groups=groups,
    setProgressBar=TRUE
)
aggregated_results <- aggregateByAttributes(
    PSM=df,
    colOfReporterIonInt=samples,
    ranger=regr,
    ratioCalc=FALSE
)
```

The output dataframe will provide estimates of protein abundance.

## Ex.3: Build a Merged Training Set and Retrain the Model.

Retraining the AWA model using additional spike-in datasets can improve the number of quantified PSMs in the merged training set, and hence the robustness of the correlation. In addition, retraining using experiment-specific in-house spike-in datasets could also provide potential benefits for the machine learning model by better representing the employed hardware and acquisition modes.

In this example, we create a training set by merging three benchmark spike-in datasets (`benchmark.set.1`, `benchmark.set.2`, and `benchmark.set.3`), all included in the `AWAggregator` package and derived from the `psm.tsv` output files generated by FragPipe. This combined training set is then used to train a random forest model.

### Step 1: Load Spike-in Datasets

We load the spike-in datasets using `ExperimentHub` package. These datasets correspond to the sets described in the `AWAggregator` publication. You may substitute your own spike-in datasets if desired.

```r
library(ExperimentHub)
eh <- ExperimentHub()
benchmarkSet1 <- eh[['EH9637']] # Benchmark Set 1
benchmarkSet2 <- eh[['EH9638']] # Benchmark Set 2
benchmarkSet3 <- eh[['EH9639']] # Benchmark Set 3
```

### Step 2: Calculate PSM Attributes and Average Scaled Error of log~2~FC

Firstly, we calculate the attributes and the values of Average Scaled Error of log~2~FC in `benchmark.set.1`.

```r
samples <- c('H1+E1_1', 'H1+E1_2', 'H1+E1_3', 'H1+E2_1', 'H1+E2_2', 'H1+E2_3', 'H1+E2_4', 'H1+E6_1', 'H1+E6_2', 'H1+E6_3')
groups <- c('H1+E1', 'H1+E1', 'H1+E1', 'H1+E2', 'H1+E2', 'H1+E2', 'H1+E2', 'H1+E6', 'H1+E6', 'H1+E6')
PSM1 <- getAttributes(
    PSM=benchmarkSet1,
    # TMT tag (229.1629) and carbamidomethylation (57.0214) are applied as fixed PTMs
    fixedPTM=c('229.1629', '57.0214'),
    colOfReporterIonInt=samples,
    groups=groups
)
PSM1 <- getAvgScaledErrorOfLog2FC(
    PSM=PSM1,
    colOfReporterIonInt=samples,
    groups=groups,
    # The actual protein fold change may be deviated from the intended values after TMT labelling as the original work indicates when H1+Y6 is involved, and therefore, H1+Y6 is not used in the calculation of Average of Scaled Error of log2FC
    expectedRelativeAbundance=list(`H1+E1`=1, `H1+E2`=2, `H1+E6`=NA),
    speciesAtConstLevel='HUMAN'
)
```

Secondly, we calculate the attributes and the values of Average Scaled Error of log~2~FC in `benchmark.set.2`. `benchmark.set.2` consists of three separate mass spectrometry runs, each of which is processed individually.

```r
library(dplyr)
samples <- c('H1+Y1_1', 'H1+Y4_1', 'H1+Y10_1', 'H1+Y1_2', 'H1+Y4_2', 'H1+Y10_2', 'H1+Y1_3', 'H1+Y4_3', 'H1+Y10_3')
groups <- c('H1+Y1', 'H1+Y4', 'H1+Y10', 'H1+Y1', 'H1+Y4', 'H1+Y10', 'H1+Y1', 'H1+Y4', 'H1+Y10')
PSM2 <- bind_rows(lapply(unique(benchmarkSet2$Replicate), FUN=function(X){
    df <- getAttributes(
        PSM=benchmarkSet2[benchmarkSet2$Replicate == X, ],
        fixedPTM=c('229.1629', '57.0214'),
        colOfReporterIonInt=samples,
        groups=groups,
        setProgressBar=FALSE
    )
    df <- getAvgScaledErrorOfLog2FC(
        PSM=df,
        colOfReporterIonInt=samples,
        groups=groups,
        expectedRelativeAbundance=list(`H1+Y1`=1, `H1+Y4`=4, `H1+Y10`=10),
        speciesAtConstLevel='HUMAN'
    )
    return(df)
}))
```

Thirdly, we calculate the attributes and the values of Average Scaled Error of log~2~FC in `benchmark.set.3`.

```r
samples <- c('H1+Y0_1', 'H1+Y1_1', 'H1+Y5_1', 'H1+Y10_1', 'H1+Y10_2', 'H1+Y5_2', 'H1+Y1_2', 'H1+Y0_2')
groups <- c('H1+Y0', 'H1+Y1', 'H1+Y5', 'H1+Y10', 'H1+Y10', 'H1+Y5', 'H1+Y1', 'H1+Y0')
PSM3 <- getAttributes(
    PSM=benchmarkSet3,
    fixedPTM=c('304.2071', '125.0476'),
    colOfReporterIonInt=samples,
    groups=groups,
    # The signals for yeast PSMs in group H1+Y0 is completely from noise, so they are not used for calculating Average CV
    groupsExcludedFromCV='H1+Y0'
)
PSM3 <- getAvgScaledErrorOfLog2FC(
    PSM=PSM3,
    colOfReporterIonInt=samples,
    groups=groups,
    expectedRelativeAbundance=list(`H1+Y0`=0, `H1+Y1`=1, `H1+Y5`=5, `H1+Y10`=10),
    speciesAtConstLevel='HUMAN'
)
```

### Step 3: Merge Spike-in Datasets as a New Training Set

Next, we merge a new training set from these three datasets. The minimum number of PSMs to extract from each dataset is determined by the number of PSMs in the smallest set. Complete sets of PSMs mapped to the selected proteins are extracted, resulting in final PSM counts from each set that are equal to or slightly larger than the preset values.

```r
set.seed(1000)
PSM <- mergeTrainingSets(
    PSMList=list(
        `Benchmark Set 1`=PSM1,
        `Benchmark Set 2`=PSM2,
        `Benchmark Set 3`=PSM3
    ),
    numPSMs=min(nrow(PSM1), nrow(PSM2), nrow(PSM3))
)
```

### Step 4: Train a New Random Forest Model

Train a new random forest model using Average CV as an attribute.

```r
regr <- fitModel(PSM, useAvgCV=TRUE, seed=3979)
```
